NAME: Coal Data
SIZE: 29 observations, 11 variables
 
DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Logistic Regression relating Coal pillar stability (Yes/No) to width/height ratio and 
Strength/Stress ratio for pillars from 29 mine seams.

Pillars in underground coal mines are mainly designed to
ensure the protection of roadways and entries. Pillars stability is
consequently the most important factor that must be guaranteed
through the entire life of mine that can be years or even decades
long.

For this data set, a representative sample of over eight hundred, 2005 GM cars were selected, 
then an algorithm was developed following the 2005 Central Edition of the Kelly Blue Book to 
estimate retail price. </p>

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
Pillar - ID variable
